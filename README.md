# Dependencies

- `bash`, `curl`, `tar`: generic POSIX utilities.
- `python` version 3.3 or greater.
    - This plugin will use the system `python3` to create a virtualenv in the ASDF_INSTALL_PATH. It will then install cookiecutter into that virtualenv, and create a symlink from the `ASDF_INSTALL_PATH/bin` folder to the binary in the virtualenv folder.

# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add cookiecutter
# or
asdf plugin add cookiecutter https://github.com/shawon-crosen/asdf-cookiecutter.git
```

cookiecutter:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list all cookiecutter

# Install latest version
asdf install cookiecutter latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global cookiecutter latest

# Now cookiecutter commands are available
cookiecutter --version
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
